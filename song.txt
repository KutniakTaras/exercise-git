If you never go out
You may it
You'll never gibe up 
Give all in your hand

Open the door
I see ypu again
Open the door 
----------------

You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head
And I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken


I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
When it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I, I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
Of who I am and all I've ever known
Loving you's the antidote

Golden
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head
And I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

for tag only!
